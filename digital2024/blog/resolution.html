                On Resolution
            </h1>
            <p>
                <cite>Powers of Ten</cite> is a short film by Charles and Ray Eames (1977). Starting at a picnic by the lakeside in Chicago, this famous film transports us from the Earth until the entire universe is surveyed, then reducing inward until a single atom and its quarks are observed. Every ten seconds we view the starting point from ten times farther.

                While a ’resolution’ generally simply refers to a standard measurement in a technological context (framerate, number of pixels etc.), Dutch artist-researcher Rosa Menkman reflects that resolution is another means of controlling what is visible and what is hidden. How resolution acts as a tool for mass surveillance and reinforcing gender and racial biases is reflected upon Menkman's work in the video.

            <blockquote>
                By going beyond resolution, I attempt to uncover and elucidate how resolutions constantly inform both machine vision and human perception. I unpack the ways resolutions organize our contemporary image processing technologies, emphasizing that resolutions not only organize how and what gets seen, but also what images, settings, ways of rendering and points of view are forgotten, obfuscated, or simply dismissed and unsupport.

                The German artist Hito Steyerl addresses the way digital images are created, shared and archived. Her film <cite>How Not to Be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational .MOV File</cite> (2013) takes the form of an instructional video which flips playfully between 'real world' footage and digital recreations. Inspired by Monty Python, the work balances critique and humour, showing how 'not being seen' has both oppressive and liberating possibilities.
