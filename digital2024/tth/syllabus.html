            This course is an introduction to the practical and creative uses of digital tools for art and design. The course is structured for a fundamental understanding of digital art and technology in three core components: <span>Pixel, Vector,</span> and <span>Time</span>.
            <br><br>
            Each unit provides technical knowledge for the most common tools in the field, including standard practices in resolution, formatting, and file management. Pixel introduces raster image-making in Photoshop. Vector focuses on creating geometry-based drawings in Illustrator in respect to basic principles of art and design. Lastly, Time explores the time-based properties of motion graphics using After Effects, including how time can be (de)constructed or emphasized.

            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qUNiQCFkYjxMOhjEOcmkEkeKq14WSOL3Na3f2j_6VtE/edit"><span>P2: Object Logo</span></a><br>
            Design a logo based on an object in Illustrator. With a focus on process, create vector-based drawings that are representational of an everyday object. Using various techniques, explore how to visually translate something physical from real life into the digital realm.
            <br><br>

            Create a short motion graphic for a book or music festival using After Effects.
            <br><br>
            <span>P4: Self-Learning</span> <br>
            Choose a piece of digital work (vector, raster, or time-based) that you find inspirational and would like to reverse-engineer. Identify key skills and techniques used in the creation of the piece that would be beneficial to add to your skillset. Research on your own how to acquire the skills you identified using available resources. Then recreate the relevant parts (or all) of the selected piece using your own imagery or style.
