                Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
                A manifesto is a written declaration of the intentions,motives, or views of the issuer, be it an individual, group, political party, or government.
            </p>
            <p>
                Manifestos usually promote new ideas with prescriptive notions for carrying out changes the author believes should be made.

                10 Rules for Students, Teachers, and Life
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the 1960s, artist, educator, and social justice advocate Corita Kent asked her students to collectively reimagine what a learning environment could be. Their contributions comprised the now widely recognizable Immaculate Heart College Art Department Rules (commonly referred to as “Ten Rules”).
